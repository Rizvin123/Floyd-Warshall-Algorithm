### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains two implementations of the Floyd–Warshall algorithm for computing shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted directed graph.

The algorithm is implemented in:

1) An iterative version using three nested loops.

2) A recursive version that simulates the same triple-loop logic without using loops.

The purpose of this repository is to:

1) Demonstrate equivalence between iterative and recursive approaches.

2) Compare performance characteristics of both implementations.

3) Provide unit tests to validate correctness.

4) Maintain code quality using PEP 8 and pylint standards.
